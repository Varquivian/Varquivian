## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a rising senior in Queens, NY. I love computational neuroscience, applied math, classical mechanics, thermodynamics, neurobiology, psychopharmacology, physiology, game development, and art. I also want to be visually literate. 

In my free time, I love watching YouTube documentaries and comics. I am also attempting to learn Minecraft controls so I don't immediately die from a skeleton.

I don't have much professional experience. I mostly work as a volunteer accountant at a local community youth organization. I am also interning at NYSCI at the moment. I might try to brainstorm a curriculum for my tutoring organization that I founded, although I have zero knowledge on how to manage one.

Here's my LinkedIn: [Shabaab Hasnatt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shabaab-hasnatt-11a8801b9/)
